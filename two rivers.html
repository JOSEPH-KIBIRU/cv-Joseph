    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>Two Rivers Mall, located on Limuru Road in Ruaka, Nairobi, is East Africa’s largest shopping centre, covering 65,000 square meters. It overtook Garden City Mall (50,000 sq m) on Thika Road to claim the title of the region’s largest mall.

    The mall is part of a Sh25.1 billion mixed-use project undertaken by Two Rivers Lifestyle Company on 102 acres of land acquired from the Koinange family for Sh1 billion.
    
    Two Rivers Mall Nairobi was originally to cover a total of 1.2 million square feet of land but this was increased to 1.7 million square feet in a bid to raise the lettable space from the original 460,000 square feet to over 700,000 square feet.
